# Agent Behavior Rules

## Knowledge File Updates
- Do NOT update the knowledge file (`project-context.mdc`) without explicit user permission
- Only update the knowledge file after test cases have passed successfully and the user confirms
- Always ask before modifying any rule file in `.cursor/rules/`

## Implementation Workflow
- ALWAYS propose the solution first and wait for user approval before writing any code
- This applies in ALL modes (Agent, Ask, Plan, Debug) -- explain the approach, then implement only after user confirms
- Never jump straight to implementation without explaining what you plan to do and why

## General
- Ask permission before making changes outside the scope of the current task
- Do not proactively create or modify documentation/rule files unless explicitly requested
